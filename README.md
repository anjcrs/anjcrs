## More About Me
When I first stepped into this field, I wasnâ€™t completely sure it was for me. But the more I kept moving forward, the more I found myself slowly falling in love with this fieldâ€”and Iâ€™ve come to romanticize the process of making the journey my own. I enjoy experimenting with ideas, solving problems, and building discipline along the way. Every small progress feels like a win, and I see challenges not as setbacks but as opportunities to improve. With consistency, grit, and curiosity, Iâ€™m embracing this path fully and making it my own.
